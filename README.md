# GEMSTONE PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT -Precisied and Accurate


This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of diamonds based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

We have used various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression,ElasticNet,Lasso,Ridge After extensive testing and evaluation, we have selected the Linear Regression algorithm as the best fit for this particular problem.

We have also developed a simple web application using Flask, which allows users to input the features of a diamond and receive a predicted price based on the model's output.

Hope this project will be helpful to diamond sellers, buyers, and enthusiasts in making informed decisions. Thank you for your interest in this project!

## Deployment
USING MICROSOFT AZURE DEPLOYMENT
# Step 1: Azure Account Setup
Creating an Azure account at https://portal.azure.com .
Setting up Azure subscription and ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
# Step 2: Resource Creation
Open the Azure portal.
Click on "Create a resource" and search for the desired resources (e.g., Virtual Machine, App Service, etc.) 
Review and create the resources.
# Step 3: Configuration
 Creating Linux Web app Server 
# Step 4: Deployment
Depending on your project, you may need to package your code and deploy it to Azure. Common deployment methods include:
1. Publishing your application directly from Visual Studio or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Using continuous deployment options like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Azure Pipelines. I have used github for deployment of this project 
3. Deploying containerized applications using Azure Container Registry, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Azure App Service 
# Additional Resources
 For more detailed information on Azure deployment options and best practices, refer to the Azure documentation.
 If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, search for solutions in the Azure Knowledge Base.
