# GEMSTONE PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT -Precisied and Accurate


This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of diamonds based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

We have used various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression,ElasticNet,Lasso,Ridge After extensive testing and evaluation, we have selected the Linear Regression algorithm as the best fit for this particular problem.

We have also developed a simple web application using Flask, which allows users to input the features of a diamond and receive a predicted price based on the model's output.

Hope this project will be helpful to diamond sellers, buyers, and enthusiasts in making informed decisions. Thank you for your interest in this project!
